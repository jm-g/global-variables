{-# LANGUAGE DeriveDataTypeable #-}
-- | 'Data.Global' provides a kind of global variables - 'GVar' - tailored to
-- solve the /configuration problem/. 'GVar's are global variables
-- identified by a name. This allows GVars to be obtained in pure
-- code.
--
-- The following two lines can be added to as many modules as you
-- want. And 'aGlobalVar' will always refer to the same global
-- variable.
-- 
-- > aGlobalVar :: GVar Integer
-- > aGlobalVar = declare "my-global-variable-name"
--
-- Note, there is no need to use 'unsafePerformIO' or @NOINLINE@
-- pragmas. Yet GVars can be used similar to IORefs.

-- TODO:
-- - use System.Mem.Weak and finalizers to collect garbage.

-- Strictness requirements:
--
-- In order to avoid a nested atomically exception, due to unsafePerformIO
-- nesting STM contexts, it is necessary to ensure that any call to
-- Data.Global.Internal.lookupGVar is not executed inside an atomically block.
--
--
-- To achieve this, we follow the following two principles:
--
-- 1. The unique value is strictly stored in GVar constructor.
--
-- 2. Every function has to pattern match on a value of type GVar before it is
-- handed to a atomically block.

-- Design decisions
--
-- There are (at least) two possible semantics of allGVars 
--
-- 1. all variables declared 
--
-- 2. all variables declareed and currently set
--
-- 1. Has the advantage of being cheaper to implement, but is subject to the
-- same problems of hGetContents, aka. lazy IO. The result of an IO action
-- (allGVars) depends on the evaluation order of pure expressions containing
-- calls to declare. Implementing 1. would also mean to expose garbage
-- collection of declared variables. Therefore I'd say we implement variant 2.

-- | List all declared and existing GVars.

-- $costModel
-- This module is designed to follow a simple cost model.
--
-- 1. The declaration of a 'GVar' is quite expensive, assume @O(log n)@
-- where @n@ is the amount of GVars declared so far. All declarations
-- are synchronized, i.e. sequentialized.
--
-- 2. Reading and writing of a 'GVar' is a constant cost operation
-- which may block on concurrent reads or writes on the same
-- 'GVar'. Reading and writing to different GVars does not lead block.
